Multithreaded ELF disassembler.

Currently only performs disassembly on x86_64 ELF executables.

Use PTH_NUM_THREADS to control the number of threads to create to aid in disassembly.

If capstone could not be found, then try building capstone with the capstone
submodule included in this project and then run elf_parser.out with
LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to the libcapstone.so symlink in the current directory.
